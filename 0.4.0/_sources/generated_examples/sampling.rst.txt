How to sample video clips
=========================

In this example, we'll learn how to sample video :term:`clips` from a video. A
clip generally denotes a sequence or batch of frames, and is typically passed as
input to video models.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 18-21

First, a bit of boilerplate: we'll download a video from the web, and define a
plotting utility. You can ignore that part and jump right below to
:ref:`sampling_tuto_start`.

Creating a decoder
------------------

Sampling clips from a video always starts by creating a
:class:`~torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder` object. If you're not already
familiar with :class:`~torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder`, take a quick look
at: :ref:`sphx_glr_generated_examples_basic_example.py`.

Sampling basics
---------------

We can now use our decoder to sample clips. Let's first look at a simple
example: all other samplers follow similar APIs and principles. We'll use
:func:`~torchcodec.samplers.clips_at_random_indices` to sample clips that
start at random indices.

The output of the sampler is a sequence of clips, represented as
:class:`~torchcodec.FrameBatch` object. In this object, we have different
fields:

- ``data``: a 5D uint8 tensor representing the frame data. Its shape is
  (num_clips, num_frames_per_clip, ...) where ... is either (C, H, W) or (H,
  W, C), depending on the ``dimension_order`` parameter of the
  :class:`~torchcodec.decoders.VideoDecoder`. This is typically what would get
  passed to the model.
- ``pts_seconds``: a 2D float tensor of shape (num_clips, num_frames_per_clip)
  giving the starting timestamps of each frame within each clip, in seconds.
- ``duration_seconds``: a 2D float tensor of shape (num_clips,
  num_frames_per_clip) giving the duration of each frame within each clip, in
  seconds.

Indexing and manipulating clips
-------------------------------

Clips are :class:`~torchcodec.FrameBatch` objects, and they support native
pytorch indexing semantics (including fancy indexing). This makes it easy to
filter clips based on a given criteria. For example, from the clips above we
can easily filter out those who start *after* a specific timestamp:

.. note::
  A more natural and efficient way to get clips after a given timestamp is to
  rely on the sampling range parameters, which we'll cover later in :ref:`sampling_range`.

Index-based and Time-based samplers
-----------------------------------

So far we've used  :func:`~torchcodec.samplers.clips_at_random_indices`.
Torchcodec support additional samplers, which fall under two main categories:

Index-based samplers:

-  :func:`~torchcodec.samplers.clips_at_random_indices`
-  :func:`~torchcodec.samplers.clips_at_regular_indices`

Time-based samplers:

-  :func:`~torchcodec.samplers.clips_at_random_timestamps`
-  :func:`~torchcodec.samplers.clips_at_regular_timestamps`

All these samplers follow similar APIs and the time-based samplers have
analogous parameters to the index-based ones. Both samplers types generally
offer comparable performance in terms speed.

.. note::
  Is it better to use a time-based sampler or an index-based sampler? The
  index-based samplers have arguably slightly simpler APIs and their behavior
  is possibly simpler to understand and control, because of the discrete
  nature of indices. For videos with constant fps, an index-based sampler
  behaves exactly the same as a time-based samplers. For videos with variable
  fps however (as is often the case), relying on indices may under/over sample
  some regions in the video, which may lead to undersirable side effects when
  training a model. Using a time-based sampler ensures uniform sampling
  caracteristics along the time-dimension.

.. _sampling_range:

Advanced parameters: sampling range
-----------------------------------

Sometimes, we may not want to sample clips from an entire video. We may only
be interested in clips that start within a smaller interval. In samplers, the
``sampling_range_start`` and ``sampling_range_end`` parmeters control the
sampling range: they define where we allow clips to *start*. There are two
important things to keep in mind:

- ``sampling_range_end`` is an *open* upper-bound: clips may only start within
  [sampling_range_start, sampling_range_end).
- Because these parameter define where a clip can start, clips may contain
  frames *after*  ``sampling_range_end``!

Advanced parameters: policy
---------------------------

Depending on the length or duration of the video and on the sampling
parameters, the sampler may try to sample frames *beyond* the end of the
video. The ``policy`` parameter defines how such invalid frames should be
replaced with valid
frames.

We see above that the end of the video is at 13.8s. The sampler tries to
sample frames at timestamps [13.28, 13.68, 14.08, ...] but 14.08 is an invalid
timestamp, beyond the end video. With the "repeat_last" policy, which is the
default, the sampler simply repeats the last frame at 13.68 seconds to
construct the clip.

An alternative policy is "wrap": the sampler then wraps-around the clip and repeats the first few valid frames as necessary:

    torch.manual_seed(0)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 247-252

By default, the value of ``sampling_range_end`` is automatically set such that
the sampler *doesn't* try to sample frames beyond the end of the video: the
default value ensures that clips start early enough before the end. This means
that by default, the policy parameter rarely comes into action, and most users
probably don't need to worry too much about it.
