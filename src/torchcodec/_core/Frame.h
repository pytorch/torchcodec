// FRAME TENSOR ALLOCATION APIs
// --------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Note [Frame Tensor allocation and height and width]
//
// We always allocate [N]HWC tensors. The low-level decoding functions all
// assume HWC tensors, since this is what FFmpeg natively handles. It's up to
// the high-level decoding entry-points to permute that back to CHW, by calling
// maybePermuteHWC2CHW().
//
// TODO: Rationalize the comment below with refactoring.
//
// Also, importantly, the way we figure out the the height and width of the
// output frame tensor varies, and depends on the decoding entry-point. In
// *decreasing order of accuracy*, we use the following sources for determining
// height and width:
// - getHeightAndWidthFromResizedAVFrame(). This is the height and width of the
//   AVframe, *post*-resizing. This is only used for single-frame decoding APIs,
//   on CPU, with filtergraph.
// - getHeightAndWidthFromOptionsOrAVFrame(). This is the height and width from
//   the user-specified options if they exist, or the height and width of the
//   AVFrame *before* it is resized. In theory, i.e. if there are no bugs within
//   our code or within FFmpeg code, this should be exactly the same as
//   getHeightAndWidthFromResizedAVFrame(). This is used by single-frame
//   decoding APIs, on CPU with swscale, and on GPU.
// - getHeightAndWidthFromOptionsOrMetadata(). This is the height and width from
//   the user-specified options if they exist, or the height and width form the
//   stream metadata, which itself got its value from the CodecContext, when the
//   stream was added. This is used by batch decoding APIs, for both GPU and
//   CPU.
//
// The source of truth for height and width really is the (resized) AVFrame: it
// comes from the decoded ouptut of FFmpeg. The info from the metadata (i.e.
// from the CodecContext) may not be as accurate. However, the AVFrame is only
// available late in the call stack, when the frame is decoded, while the
// CodecContext is available early when a stream is added. This is why we use
// the CodecContext for pre-allocating batched output tensors (we could
// pre-allocate those only once we decode the first frame to get the info frame
// the AVFrame, but that's a more complex logic).
//
// Because the sources for height and width may disagree, we may end up with
// conflicts: e.g. if we pre-allocate a batch output tensor based on the
// metadata info, but the decoded AVFrame has a different height and width.
// it is very important to check the height and width assumptions where the
// tensors memory is used/filled in order to avoid segfaults.
