# This job is not directly related to regular CI pipeline.
# It is intended to create FFmpeg binaries that we upload on S3,
# which then will be used during all the build process in CI or local.
#
# This job does not include the uploading part.
# Upload needs to be done manually, and it should be done only once
# par new major release of FFmepg.
