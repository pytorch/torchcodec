          # Note: we're not setting BUILD_AGAINST_ALL_FFMPEG_FROM_S3 here, so
          # we're building libtorchcodec against the installed FFmpeg version
          # (from conda-forge) instead of building against our pre-built non-GPL
          # FFmpeg libraries.
          # The reason we need this is because the C++ tests decode x264 files.
          # x264 support is not LGPL, os it is not supported by our
          # pre-built non-GPL FFmpeg libraries. And if we were to build against
          # those, this is also what the tests would be loading at run time,
          # then failing when we try to decode x264.
          # To remediate that, we build against the FFmpeg that we installed
          # from conda-forge (which is able to decode x264), and that's also
          # what gets loaded at run time.
          # The Python tests are also decoding x264 files, and are built against
          # our non-GPL FFmpeg. And yet they pass. This is because in Python
          # we're able to distinguish between build-time (non-GPL FFmpeg) and
          # run time (conda-forge FFmpeg).
